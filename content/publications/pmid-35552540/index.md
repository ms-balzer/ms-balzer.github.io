abstract: "Inflammation is an important component of fibrosis but immune processes that orchestrate kidney fibrosis are not well understood. Here we apply single-cell sequencing to a mouse model of kidney fibrosis. We identify a subset of kidney tubule cells with a profibrotic-inflammatory phenotype characterized by the expression of cytokines and chemokines associated with immune cell recruitment. Receptor-ligand interaction analysis and experimental validation indicate that CXCL1 secreted by profibrotic tubules recruits CXCR2+ basophils. In mice, these basophils are an important source of interleukin-6 and recruitment of the TH17 subset of helper T cells. Genetic deletion or antibody-based depletion of basophils results in reduced renal fibrosis. Human kidney single-cell, bulk gene expression and immunostaining validate a function for basophils in patients with kidney fibrosis. Collectively, these studies identify basophils as contributors to the development of renal fibrosis and suggest that targeting these cells might be a useful clinical strategy to manage chronic kidney disease."
