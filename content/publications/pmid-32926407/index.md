abstract: "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) employs hypertonic glucose to remove excess water and uremic waste. Peritoneal membrane failure limits its long-term use. T-cell cytokines promote this decline. T-cell differentiation is critically determined by the microenvironment. We here study how PD-range hypertonic glucose regulates T-cell polarization and IL-17 production. In the human peritoneal cavity, CD3+ cell numbers increased in PD. Single cell RNA sequencing detected expression of T helper (Th) 17 signature genes RORC and IL23R. In vitro, PD-range glucose stimulated spontaneous and amplified cytokine-induced Th17 polarization. Osmotic controls l-glucose and d-mannose demonstrate that induction of IL-17A is a substance-independent, tonicity dose-dependent process. PD-range glucose upregulated glycolysis and increased the proportion of dysfunctional mitochondria. Blockade of reactive-oxygen species (ROS) prevented IL-17A induction in response to PD-range glucose. Peritoneal mesothelium cultured with IL-17A or IL17F produced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, CCL2, and CX3CL1. In PD patients, peritoneal IL-17A positively correlated with CX3CL1 concentrations. PD-range glucose-stimulated, but neither identically treated Il17a-/- Il17f-/- nor T cells cultured with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine enhanced mesothelial CX3CL1 expression. Our data delineate PD-range hypertonic glucose as a novel inducer of Th17 polarization in a mitochondrial-ROS-dependent manner. Modulation of tonicity-mediated effects of PD solutions may improve membrane survival."
