Although the kidney has a remarkable capacity for adaptation and recovery, previous studies have focused mainly on injury signatures. As a result, promising treatments that were effective in animal models have failed in humans. Investigations that directly address the kidney’s adaptive mechanisms are still lacking—primarily because adaptation signals are masked by the noise of injury and inflammation. SINGuLAR therefore makes use of a unique human model: living kidney donors permanently lose 50% of their renal mass, yet the remaining kidney shows striking compensatory growth and functional adaptation — free from disease-related confounders. We study these adapting kidney cells and, for the first time, generate a prospective single-cell map of kidney adaptation. In addition, we investigate epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, spatial and temporal patterns, and the relationship between donor adaptation and transplant outcomes. SINGuLAR aims to provide fundamental insights into the natural regeneration of the human kidney and to open new avenues for therapeutically harnessing these mechanisms in the future.

The project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant).
