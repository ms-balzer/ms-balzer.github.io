Acute kidney injury (AKI), despite the kidney’s immense reparative capacity, often progresses to chronic kidney disease affecting more than 850 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no drugs that can prevent or halt the decline in kidney function following acute damage. Modern single-cell analytical techniques hold the potential to fundamentally transform our understanding of disease processes at the cellular level. This project aims to identify cellular signatures, so-called “endophenotypes” that distinguish successful organ repair from maladaptive regeneration leading to fibrosis. By doing so, it seeks to challenge traditional paradigms in the characterization of kidney diseases and lay the foundation for the development of targeted therapies for AKI.

The project is supported by the Else Kröner-Fresenius Foundation, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and the Sonnenfeld Foundation.
