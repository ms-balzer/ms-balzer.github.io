The kidney has a complex anatomical architecture composed of more than 30 specialized cell types. Novel approaches such as transcriptome and epigenome sequencing at the single-cell level (sc/snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq) provide unprecedented insight into the molecular and cellular composition of healthy and diseased kidneys. However, these methods rely on tissue dissociation and remove the spatial context of the cellular niche (microenvironment). In contrast, spatial transcriptomics enables the readout of cell type–specific transcription while simultaneously preserving information on tissue organization. To date, no comprehensive spatial map exists that differentiates shared and specific pathophysiological features before, during, and after ischemia/reperfusion in human kidney samples. SPIRIT-K aims to fill this gap.

The project is supported by the Dr. Werner Jackstädt Foundation.
